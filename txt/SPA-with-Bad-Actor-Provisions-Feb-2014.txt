                  SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

                               Preliminary Note
The Stock Purchase Agreement sets forth the basic terms of the purchase and sale of the preferred stock to the investors (such as the purchase price, closing date, conditions to closing) and identifies the other financing documents.  Generally this agreement does not set forth either (1) the characteristics of the stock being sold (which are defined in the Certificate of Incorporation) or (2) the relationship among the parties after the closing, such as registration rights, rights of first refusal and co-sale, voting arrangements (these matters often implicate other persons than just the Company and the investors in this round of financing, and are usually embodied in separate agreements to which those others persons are parties, or in some cases by the Certificate of Incorporation). The main items of negotiation in the Stock Purchase Agreement are therefore the price and number of shares being sold, and the representations and warranties that the Company, and sometimes the Founders as well, must make to the investors.

Neither the Company nor, to the Company's knowledge, any of its officers, directors or Key Employees is a party or is named as subject to the provisions of any order, writ, injunction, judgment or decree of any court or government agency or instrumentality (in the case of officers, directors or Key Employees, such as would affect the Company).  There is no action, suit, proceeding or investigation by the Company pending or which the Company intends to initiate.  The foregoing includes, without limitation, actions, suits, proceedings or investigations pending or threatened in writing (or any basis therefor known to the Company) involving the prior employment of any of the Company's employees, their services provided in connection with the Company's business, any information or techniques allegedly proprietary to any of their former employers or their obligations under any agreements with prior employers.
            2.8	Intellectual Property
            .  [The Company owns or possesses or [believes it] can acquire on commercially reasonable terms sufficient legal rights to all Company Intellectual Property without any known conflict with, or infringement of, the rights of others.]  To the Company's knowledge, no product or service marketed or sold (or proposed to be marketed or sold) by the Company violates or will violate any license or infringes or will infringe any intellectual property rights of any other party.  Other than with respect to commercially available software products under standard end-user object code license agreements, there are no outstanding options, licenses, agreements, claims, encumbrances or shared ownership interests of any kind relating to the Company Intellectual Property, nor is the Company bound by or a party to any options, licenses or agreements of any kind with respect to the patents, trademarks, service marks, trade names, copyrights, trade secrets, licenses, information, proprietary rights and processes of any other Person.  The Company has not received any communications alleging that the Company has violated, or by conducting its business, would violate any of the patents, trademarks, service marks, tradenames, copyrights, trade secrets, mask works or other proprietary rights or processes of any other Person.  The Company has obtained and possesses valid licenses to use all of the software programs present on the computers and other software-enabled electronic devices that it owns or leases or that it has otherwise provided to its employees for their use in connection with the Company's business.  To the Company's knowledge, it will not be necessary to use any inventions of any of its employees or consultants (or Persons it currently intends to hire) made prior to their employment by the Company.  Each employee and consultant has assigned to the Company all intellectual property rights he or she owns that are related to the Company's business as now conducted and as presently proposed to be conducted.  Subsection 0 of the Disclosure Schedule lists all Company Intellectual Property.  The Company has not embedded any open source, copyleft or community source code in any of its products generally available or in development, including but not limited to any libraries or code licensed under any General Public License, Lesser General Public License or similar license arrangement.  For purposes of this Subsection 0, the Company shall be deemed to have knowledge of a patent right if the Company has actual knowledge of the patent right or would be found to be on notice of such patent right as determined by reference to United States patent laws.
            2.9	Compliance with Other Instruments
         2.5. .  The Company is not in violation or default (i) of any provisions of its Restated Certificate or Bylaws, (ii) of any instrument, judgment, order, writ or decree, (iii) under any note, indenture or mortgage, or (iv) under any lease, agreement, contract or purchase order to which it is a party or by which it is bound that is required to be listed on the Disclosure Schedule, or (v) [to its knowledge,] of any provision of federal or state statute, rule or regulation applicable to the Company, the violation of which would have a Material Adverse Effect.  The execution, delivery and performance of the Transaction Agreements and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements will not result in any such violation or be in conflict with or constitute, with or without the passage of time and giving of notice, either (i) a default under any such provision, instrument, judgment, order, writ, decree, contract or agreement; or (ii) an event which results in the creation of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any assets of the Company or the suspension, revocation, forfeiture, or nonrenewal of any material permit or license applicable to the Company.
